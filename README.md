# DEPENDENCIES :vertical_traffic_light:

## MATLAB
MATLAB is a tool for the simulations and main mathematical algorithms that involve symbolic complex operations for robotics.
```
https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html
```

## PYTHON
Python is used for different alternatives and programs to directly work with the robotic algorithms (usually programed on top of ROS and Numpy libraries).
```
https://www.python.org
```


## ROS
This Robot Operating System is great for programming algorithms for industrial robots (must have Ubunty dependencies correctly checked).
```
https://www.ros.org
```

# Usage :pencil2:
All projects are really well commented and most of them have specifications and remarks for their purpose and I/O.
I will be uploading most of the files, and try to keep it as clean as possible.


## Special thanks :gift:
