# DEPENDENCIES

## MATLAB
MATLAB is really important for the simulations and main mathematical algorithms involved in robotics.

## PYTHON
Python is used for different alternatives and programs to directly work with the robotic algorithms (usually programed on top of ROS libraries).

## ROBODK
Great OpenSource Software to simulate robots in an easy way.


## ROS
This tool is great for the programming algorithms involved on industrial robots (must have Ubunty dependencies correctly checked).
